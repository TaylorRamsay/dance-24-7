# dance-24-7
## What is it?
This is an ongoing game project I am working on in Unity. The general idea of the game is to explore environments while searching for characters that emit individual audio tracks. Each audio track is part of a song and as you progress, much like finding the pieces of a puzzle, and entire song is built. In addition to this, data from each track has been extracted and imported into Unity to produce visual effects on the characters emitting the respective audio track. See my other [repository](https://github.com/TaylorRamsay/.wav-sample-extractor) to see how this is accomplished.

## How to play
Locate the .zip file "d24-7.zip" and download it to a machine running Windows. Use your preferred method of file extraction and select "Dance 24-7.exe" to run the game.
